# wdio-cucumber-json-reporter
Cucumber JSON reporter

## About this repo ##

This is a fork of the work previously done here: https://github.com/AlexGalichenko/wdio-cucumber-json-reporter

I have adapted and added missing properties to the JSON report.

## Usage ##
1. `yarn add wdio-json-cucumber-reporter` or `npm install wdio-json-cucumber-reporter`
2. Add 'json-cucumber' to the list of reporters in wdio.conf.js
3. Run your tests
4. Added bonus: `yarn add multiple-cucumber-html-reporter` and follow their readme to create a beautiful HTML report.
